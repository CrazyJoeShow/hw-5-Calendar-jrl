### This is a day planner for the hours of 9am-5pm

## ==============================================================

The application is rather simple in a sense of the user is just adding to-do's to a pre-set hour block. On the flip-side I spent countless hours in the sandbox trying to figure out how to get syntax for moment.js correct in how I was trying to use it.

I used the array pulled from storage to dynamically generate the users content inthe corresponding block, because it's already there in the storage i just need to essentially save it, call it, and append to the page.

Lots of dissecting other's code with different attack approaches with the time and saving the users input and displaying.
The Office hours prior to and after class were quite helpful this week as there were a couple questions pertaining to this project.
