### This is a day planner for the hours of 9am-5pm

## ==============================================================

The application is rather simple in a sense of the user is just adding to-do's to a pre-set hour block. On the flip-side I spent countless hours in the sandbox trying to figure out how to get syntax for moment.js correct in how I was trying to use it.

I found that working in the sandbox has been a little more effiecient I can have two files one outside of the the project currently working, I have been having the same file instance happening because i had 2 VScodes editing the same file. I am slowly learning the little things.

Lots of dissecting other's code with different attack approaches to try to look at shorter, and cleaner code that still got what I was trying do across to the user.
The Office hours prior to and after class were quite helpful this week as there were a couple questions pertaining to this project.

### =============================================================

Brad Traversy on Youtube had some great tutorials and a different angle on jQuery which has helped me through the past week with jQuery, and specifically but not related ajax.
